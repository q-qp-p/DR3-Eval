Enhanced VQA MCP Server

This MCP server exposes the Enhanced VQA tool as a callable interface for LLM agents.
It wraps the enhanced_vqa module to provide:

1. Multi-turn vision understanding with automatic follow-up questions
2. Confidence scoring and metadata extraction
3. Cross-validation with web search
4. Support for multiple VLLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Qwen, Custom)

Usage by LLM:
    The LLM can call this tool via MCP with:
    - Tool: vision_understanding_advanced
    - Parameters:
        - image_path_or_url: Path or URL to image
        - question: Main question about the image
        - enable_verification: Whether to perform multi-turn verification (default: true)

    Advanced vision understanding with multi-turn verification and confidence scoring.
    
    This tool provides enhanced image understanding capabilities:
    - Multi-turn verification for higher accuracy
    - Confidence scoring for reliability assessment
    - Metadata extraction (objects, colors, text, scene)
    - Optional cross-validation with web search
    - Support for multiple VLLM providers
